# Back door attack
in this topology we are going to use python scripts as a Trajon to create a back door on the victim computer
to copy files from victim machine, delete files on this target, send file to this machine etc.


# :zap: How this works :zap: 
:star: Step 1: Firs, imagine that this target has downloaded a file from internet and inside this file there is a Trojan file that need to be 
executed to create a connection from target machine to our computer, then we are ready to go. 

in this topology, the computers are in different vlans, and we are going to create the back door from PC called Target to the hacker's computer called attacker.
